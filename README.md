## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project. Here is a link to a [LIVE DEMO](https://rest-countries-api-react-app-b48anob8w.now.sh/)

The design reference was provided to me by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) , a site that hosts challenges that allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The Objective

Given the design mockups from Frontend Mentor, my goal was to build a site that matched those designs and was wired up to the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu)

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## What I learned

A lot of road blocks where met during the course of building out this project, however these weaknesses have got a boost in improvement and has given me more confidence as a Junior Front-End Developer.

These improvements are some the following:

- Using React with a RESTful API
- Using React with CSS styles
- Responsive CSS layouts for multiple Desktop windows and Mobile Users
- Using Context from React
- Building out component heirarchies
- Planning out and executing an application build (this is the biggest App I have built alone, thus far)

Lastly this project has given me more hours to work with React code, solving/debugging issues, and loading data from a RESTful API.
